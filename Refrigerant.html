            <ol>
                <li>Check Local Regulations:

Check local regulations and guidelines for the disposal of electronic waste. Many areas have specific rules governing the proper disposal of CRT monitors and TVs.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:

Some municipalities organize electronic waste collection events where residents can drop off old electronics for proper disposal. Check for any scheduled collection events in your community.</li>
                
                    <li>Donate or Recycle Through Manufacturers:

Some manufacturers or organizations may have programs for donating or recycling old electronics. Check with the manufacturer of your CRT device to see if they offer any take-back or recycling options.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping CRT monitors and TVs in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
