        <h1>BATTERIES</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Batteries consist of various chemical components that produce electrical energy through chemical reactions. The composition of batteries can vary depending on the type of battery. Here are some common types and their compositions: </p></b>

        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Alkaline Batteries: Zinc, manganese dioxide, and potassium hydroxide.</li>
                <li>Lithium-ion Batteries: Lithium, cobalt oxide, and other materials.</li>
            
                <li>Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) Batteries: Nickel, cadmium, and other materials.</li>
                <li>Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries: Nickel, metal hydride, and other materials.</li>
                <li> Lead-Acid Batteries:Lead dioxide, sponge lead, and sulfuric acid.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycling :
Most alkaline batteries manufactured since 1996 are made of relatively
non-hazardous materials, and can be tossed directly into the trash.
However, some states or municipalities still require that alkaline
batteries be treated as hazardous waste. In these cases, the batteries
must be recycled or dropped off at a designated facility. You may be
able to drop off alkaline batteries for recycling at a local electronics
retailer, recycling center, or community center.</li>
               
                <li>Do not store different types of batteries together. Mixing batteries
with different chemistries may result in leakage and hazardous
chemical reactions. If you have multiple types of batteries to dispose
of, bag them separately.</li>
                
                    <li>Store used batteries in a cardboard or plastic container. Storing
your batteries in a non-conductive container will reduce the risk of fire,
leakage, or rupture.  </li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
