        <h1>POLYCRYSTALLINE SOLAR PANEL </h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Polycrystalline solar panels are made using multiple silicon crystals rather than a single crystal structure. Here's what constitutes a polycrystalline solar panel:</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Silicon Wafers: These panels are made of multiple silicon wafers. </li>
                <li>Silicon Cells: Each silicon wafer is then treated to create photovoltaic cells. </li>
            
                <li>Encapsulation: The cells are typically encapsulated between multiple layers of protective materials</li>
                <li>Frame and Junction Box: Polycrystalline solar panels are housed in a durable frame, usually made of aluminum, which provides structural support and facilitates installation.</li>
                
            </ol>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>Transport and Preparation: If you're transporting the panels yourself, ensure safe handling to prevent breakage or damage. .</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
                </ol>
