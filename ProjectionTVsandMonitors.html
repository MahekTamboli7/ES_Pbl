        <h1>Projection TVs and Monitors</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Rear-projection TVs and monitors use a different technology to create images. These devices can have various components that require special handling during disposal.
       Smart TVs and Monitors:
	Smart TVs and monitors have additional electronic components for connectivity and smart features. When these devices become obsolete, they contribute to e-waste.They use a projector to project an image onto a screen, and the components involved are somewhat different. </p></b>

            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Projection System:

Projection TVs and monitors use a projection system, which typically includes a light source (lamp or LED), optics, and a projection screen. The light source generates light, and the optics focus and project the image onto the screen.</li>
                <li>Display Technology:

Different types of display technologies can be used in projection systems, including:
<pre>DLP (Digital Light Processing): Uses a digital micromirror device (DMD) chip.
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display): Uses LCD panels to modulate light.
LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon): Uses liquid crystals on a silicon backplane.</pre></li>
            
                <li>Light Source:

The light source in projection TVs and monitors is a crucial component. Traditional projection TVs often use high-intensity lamps, while modern ones may use LEDs or laser diodes for improved efficiency and lifespan.</li>
              
                <li>Color Reproduction:

CRTs are known for their good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. The technology provides vibrant and saturated colors</li>
                <li>Optical Components:

Various optical components, such as lenses and mirrors, are used to direct and focus the light onto the projection screen.</li>
            </ol>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Check Local Regulations:

Check local regulations and guidelines for the disposal of electronic waste. Many areas have specific rules governing the proper disposal of projection TVs and monitors.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:

Some municipalities organize electronic waste collection events where residents can drop off old electronics for proper disposal. Check for any scheduled collection events in your community.</li>
                
                    <li>Segregation of Components:

When disposing of projection TVs and monitors, be aware that they may contain recyclable materials such as metals and plastics. Segregate these components if possible to facilitate recycling.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping CRT monitors and TVs in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
