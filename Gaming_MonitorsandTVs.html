            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Display Panel:

Gaming monitors and TVs can use various display panel technologies, including LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), or others. The choice of panel technology affects factors like response time and color reproduction</li>
                <li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) Technologies:

Some gaming displays support technologies like NVIDIA G-Sync or AMD FreeSync, which help reduce screen tearing and stuttering by synchronizing the display's refresh rate with the graphics card's output.</li>
            
                <li>Backlighting:

Depending on the technology used, gaming displays may have different backlighting solutions, such as LED backlighting in LCD displays or self-emissive pixels in OLED displays.</li>
              
                <li>Connectivity:

Gaming displays come with various connectivity options, including HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB ports. Some gaming monitors may also include additional ports for peripherals like headphones or USB devices.</li>
                <li>Heavy and Bulky:

CRT monitors and TVs are heavy and bulky compared to modern flat-panel displays. The size and weight are due to the need for the vacuum tube.</li>
            </ol>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <liCheck Local Regulations:

Check local regulations and guidelines for the disposal of electronic waste. Many areas have specific rules governing the proper disposal of CRT monitors and TVs.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:

Some municipalities organize electronic waste collection events where residents can drop off old electronics for proper disposal. Check for any scheduled collection events in your community.</li>
                
                    <li>Donate or Recycle Through Manufacturers:

Some manufacturers or organizations may have programs for donating or recycling old electronics. Check with the manufacturer of your CRT device to see if they offer any take-back or recycling options.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:
