            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Reuse or Repurpose : Consider reusing or repurposing accessories if
they are still in good condition. For example, you can use old chargers
as backups or repurpose cables for other devices.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Donation : If your old mobile phone is still functional, consider
donating it to charities, schools, or organizations that accept used
phones.</li>
            
                <li>Separate Accessories : If you have old accessories such as chargers,
cables, or earphones, consider recycling them separately. Some
components can be recycled more efficiently when separated.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
