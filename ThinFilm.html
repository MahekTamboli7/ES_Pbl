            <b><p>Refrigerants are substances used in refrigeration systems and air conditioners to absorb and release heat, allowing these systems to cool spaces. Common refrigerants include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and hydrocarbons. The choice of refrigerant depends on factors such as environmental impact, energy efficiency, and safety.</p></b>

            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Amorphous Silicon (a-Si): These panels use non-crystalline silicon deposited on a substrate like glass, metal, or plastic</li>
                <li>Metal Components (Frame, Shelves, etc.): The outer frame, shelves, and other structural elements.</li>
            
                <li>Cadmium Telluride (CdTe): This type of thin-film solar panel uses cadmium telluride as the semiconductor material deposited on a glass substrate. </li>
                <li>Semiconductor Layers: These layers form the photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. </li>
                <li> Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS): CIGS panels use a compound of copper, indium, gallium, and selenium deposited on a substrate.</li>
            </ol>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate Components: If feasible, disassemble the panels to separate the materials. Some parts, like the glass substrate or metal components, might be recyclable separately.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
