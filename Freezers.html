            <b><p>Freezers consist of various components, each requiring specific disposal methods to minimize environmental impact and ensure safety. Here's a breakdown of the main parts and how they should be disposed of</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refrigerant: The substance responsible for cooling, often hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC).</li>
                <li>Metal Components (Frame, Shelves, etc.): The outer frame, shelves, and other structural elements.</li>
            
                <li>Plastic Components:Interior and exterior plastic parts.</li>
              
                <li> Hazardous Components (Oil, PCBs, Mercury): Oil in the cooling circuit, potentially polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or mercury in older units.</li>
                <li>Foam Insulation: Insulating foam within the walls.</li>
            </ol>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Check Local Regulations:
Contact a certified technician to safely recover refrigerants. It should not be released into the atmosphere due to its potential environmental harm.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials. Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility that accepts freezer parts.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:

Some municipalities organize electronic waste collection events where residents can drop off old electronics for proper disposal. Check for any scheduled collection events in your community.</li>
                
                    <li>Donate or Recycle Through Manufacturers:

Some manufacturers or organizations may have programs for donating or recycling old electronics. Check with the manufacturer of your CRT device to see if they offer any take-back or recycling options.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.
</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping CRT monitors and TVs in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
