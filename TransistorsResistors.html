        <h1>TRANSISTORS AND RESISTORS</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Transistors and resistors are electronic components commonly used in electronic circuits. They serve different functions and play crucial roles in controlling the flow of electrical current within a circuit.</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Transistors are semiconductor devices typically made from materials such as silicon. They consist of three layers of semiconductor material: the emitter, base, and collector. There are two main types of transistors: NPN (negative-positive-negative) and PNP (positive-negative-positive). The arrangement of these layers determines the type of transistor and its behavior.</li>
                <li>Transistors act as amplifiers or switches in electronic circuits. They can amplify weak signals, control the flow of current, and perform logical operations.</li>
            
                <li>Plastic Components:Interior and exterior plastic parts.</li>
                <li>Resistors are passive electronic components made of materials that resist the flow of electric current. They are commonly made from materials such as carbon film, metal film, or wire wound around a ceramic core.</li>
                <li> Foam Insulation: Insulating foam within the walls.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Disposal: Like transistors, resistors should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Resistors are generally not as hazardous as some other electronic components, but recycling is still recommended. Many electronic components can be taken to e-waste recycling centers or collected during community e-waste disposal events.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
