        <h1>Solar E-Waste</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>What is Solar E-Waste?</h3><br>
            <p>Solar e-waste refers to the electronic waste generated by discarded solar panels. As solar panels have a
                limited lifespan of 20-25 years, their disposal raises concerns about managing the electronic waste they
                create.</p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What does Solar Panel consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A PV module is essentially made up of glass, metal, silicon and polymer fractions. Glass and
                    aluminium, together constituting around 80% of total weight, are non-hazardous.</li>
                <li>But a few other materials used including polymers, metals, metallic compounds and alloys are
                    classified as potentially hazardous.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>Status :</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>PV module recycling is still not commercially viable</li>
                <li>PV waste recycling is still at a nascent stage globally</li>
                <li>India does not have a solar waste management policy, but it does have ambitious solar power
                    installation targets.</li>
                <li>Indiaâ€™s PV (photovoltaic) waste volume is estimated to grow to 2,00,000 tonnes by 2030 and around 2
                    million tonnes by 2050.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><br>

            <h3>Issues with Solar E-Waste Management :</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Lack of Comprehensive Policy</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many countries, including India, lack comprehensive policies
                        and regulations</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Increasing Volume of Solar Waste</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>India could generate over 34,600 tonnes of solar waste by 2030</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Limited recycling infrastructure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insufficient recycling plants and infrastructure</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>High cost of recycling</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recycling a solar panel costs between $20 and $30, while
                        landfill disposal costs $1-2</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Toxic materials in the solar waste</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solar panels contain toxic metals and minerals that can harm
                        the environment when not properly managed</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Limited awareness and enforcement</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of awareness among stakeholders and inadequate
                        enforcement of recycling regulations</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Landfill disposal</li>

            <h3>Various technologies available to extract valuable materials from solar e-waste include :</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Mechanical Shredding :</b> Solar panels can be shredded into small pieces and subsequent
                    separation techniques to recover metals like aluminium and copper.</li>
                <li><b>Thermal Treatment :</b> Thermal processes, such as pyrolysis and gasification, can be employed to
                    break down solar panels at high temperatures, recovering valuable materials and generating
                    energy-rich gases or liquids.</li>
                <li><b>Chemical Leaching :</b> Chemical solvents or acids can be used to dissolve and separate valuable
                    metals, such as silver and copper, from the solar panel components.</li>
                <li><b>Electrochemical Processes :</b> Electrochemical methods can be utilized to selectively extract
                    metals from solar panel components by applying electrical currents or potential differences.</li>
                <li><b>Automated Robotic Systems :</b> Advanced robotic systems equipped with sensors and artificial
                    intelligence can be used to identify and separate different components of solar panels for efficient
                    material recovery.</li>

                    and power purchasers</li>
                <li>Conducting surveys and assessments of existing recycling facilities to determine their technology
                    capabilities and capacity, identifying areas for improvement
                    Investing in recycling infrastructure to reduce costs, improving coordination between the energy
                    and waste sectors to handle renewable energy waste, establishing more recycling plants
