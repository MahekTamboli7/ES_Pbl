        <h1>CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Monitors and TVs</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Older monitors and TVs that use CRT technology. These displays contain leaded glass, which can be harmful to the environment if not properly handled during disposal.Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors and TVs were once the most common display technology before the widespread adoption of flat-panel displays.</p></b>

            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Technology Overview:

CRT technology involves the use of a vacuum tube containing an electron gun that emits electrons. These electrons are directed toward a phosphor-coated screen, creating images through the illumination of pixels.</li>
                <li>Design:

CRT monitors and TVs have a bulky, deep design due to the vacuum tube and electron gun assembly. The screen is typically concave and coated with phosphor dots, which emit light when struck by electrons.</li>
            
                <li>Resolution:

CRT displays are capable of various resolutions, but higher resolutions often result in smaller text and graphics due to the nature of the technology.</li>
              
                <li>Color Reproduction:

CRTs are known for their good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. The technology provides vibrant and saturated colors</li>
                <li>Heavy and Bulky:

CRT monitors and TVs are heavy and bulky compared to modern flat-panel displays. The size and weight are due to the need for the vacuum tube.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <liCheck Local Regulations:

Check local regulations and guidelines for the disposal of electronic waste. Many areas have specific rules governing the proper disposal of CRT monitors and TVs.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:

Some municipalities organize electronic waste collection events where residents can drop off old electronics for proper disposal. Check for any scheduled collection events in your community.</li>
                
                    <li>Donate or Recycle Through Manufacturers:

Some manufacturers or organizations may have programs for donating or recycling old electronics. Check with the manufacturer of your CRT device to see if they offer any take-back or recycling options.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping CRT monitors and TVs in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
