        <h1> CHARGE CONTROLLER </h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>A charge controller for a solar panel system is a crucial component that regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels. Its main functions include:</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Voltage Regulation: Ensures that the batteries or the electrical system receiving the solar power are not overcharged or undercharged. It prevents overvoltage that can damage batteries.</li>
                <li>Current Limitation: Controls the amount of current being supplied to the batteries, preventing overloading and potential damage.</li>
            
                <li>Battery Protection: Monitors the state of the batteries, preventing excessive discharge that can damage batteries by ensuring they're not drained beyond a safe level.</li>
                <li>Temperature Compensation: Some advanced charge controllers adjust the charging voltage based on the temperature to optimize charging efficiency and protect the batteries in varying weather condition</li>
                <li> Foam Insulation: Insulating foam within the walls.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Check for Recycling Options: Look for recycling facilities or electronic waste collection centers in your area that accept electronic components</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Separate Components: If possible, disassemble the charge controller and separate its components. </li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
