        <h1>ELECTRIC BATTERY</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>An electric battery is a device that stores electrical energy in the form of chemical energy and releases it through an electrical discharge. It is a crucial component in various applications, from powering small electronic devices to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Here are some key aspects of electric batteries:</p></b>

        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chemical Composition: Solar panel batteries are generally categorized into lead-acid, lithium-ion, and other emerging technologies like flow batteries or sodium-based batteries.  </li>
                <li>Anode and Cathode: Inside a battery, there are anodes (negative electrodes) and cathodes (positive electrodes). </li>
            
                <li>Electrolyte: Batteries have an electrolyte, a substance that allows the flow of ions between the anode and cathode.</li>
                <li>Separator: Batteries also contain a separator, which physically separates the anode and cathode to prevent short circuits while allowing ions to pass through.</li>
                
            </ol>
        </div><br>

        <div>
            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Secure Data Removal: Before disposing of electronic devices that may contain personal information, ensure to wipe or destroy data securely.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Professional Services: Engage professional e-waste disposal services that specialize in handling electronic waste. </li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
                </ol>
