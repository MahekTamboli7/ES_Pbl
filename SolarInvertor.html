            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>DC Input: This is where the DC power generated by the solar panels is connected to the inverter</li>
                <li>Converter Stage: The DC power is converted into AC power through a series of electronic components like transistors, capacitors, and transformers.</li>
            
                <li>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT): Many modern inverters incorporate MPPT technology, which optimizes the output of the solar panels by continuously adjusting the voltage and current to ensure the maximum power is harvested from the panels.</li>
               
            </ol>
        </div><br>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Professional Disposal Services: Engage professional electronic waste disposal or recycling services that specialize in handling electronic components like solar inverters. They have the expertise to handle these items and ensure they are recycled or disposed of properly.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Avoid Landfill Disposal: Try to avoid disposing of electronic components, including solar inverters, in regular waste bins destined for landfills. </li>
