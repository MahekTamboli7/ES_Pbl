        <h1>REFRIGERATOR</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Refrigerants are substances used in refrigeration systems and air conditioners to absorb and release heat, allowing these systems to cool spaces. Common refrigerants include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and hydrocarbons. The choice of refrigerant depends on factors such as environmental impact, energy efficiency, and safety.</p></b>

            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refrigerant:The substance responsible for cooling, often chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)</li>
                <li>Metal Components (Frame, Shelves, etc.): The outer frame, shelves, and other structural elements.</li>
            
                <li>Plastic Components:Interior and exterior plastic parts.</li>
                <li>Glass Shelves: Shelves made of glass.</li>
                <li> Foam Insulation: Insulating foam within the walls.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
