        <h1>AIR CONDITIONERS</h1>
        <div>
            <b><p>Air conditioners consist of several components, each requiring specific disposal methods to minimize environmental impact and ensure safety.</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Refrigerant:
	 The substance responsible for cooling, often hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC).</li>
                <li>Metal Components (Frame, Coils):
	 The outer frame, coils, and other structural elements</li>
            
                <li> Compressor and Motor:
 The compressor and motor drive the cooling process.</li>
              
                <li> Electronic Components:
	 Circuit boards and electronic parts.</li>
                <li> Cooling Fins and Coils:
	 Fins and coils aid in the heat exchange process.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Municipal Collection Events:Dispose of air filters according to local regulations. Some filters can be recycled, while others may need special handling due to potential contaminants.</li>
                
                    <li>Donate or Recycle Through Manufacturers:

Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility that accepts air conditioner parts.</li>            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options for returning old CRT devices.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

 Recycle electronic components through e-waste recycling programs. These components often contain valuable materials that can be recovered. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
