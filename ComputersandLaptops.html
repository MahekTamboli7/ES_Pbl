            <b><p>Electronic waste (e-waste) from the Information and Telecommunications
Technology (ICT) sector encompasses a wide range of electronic and electrical
components. Here are some of the key components that fall under Information
and Telecommunications E-Waste :</p></b>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>What do they consist of?</h3><br>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>External Cables : Unplug all external cables, including power
cords, USB cables, and other peripherals.</li>
                <li>Computer Case : Most desktop computers have a side
panel that can be removed. This is often secured with screws. Use a
screwdriver to remove the screws and gently slide off the side panel.</li>
            
                <li>Internal Cables : Inside the computer, disconnect all
internal cables, including power cables, data cables (SATA, IDE), and
any other connected components.</li>
                <li>Internal Cables : Inside the computer, disconnect all
internal cables, including power cables, data cables (SATA, IDE), and
any other connected components.</li>
                <li> CPU and Heatsink : If you need to recycle the CPU
separately, remove the heatsink carefully. CPUs are usually secured in
a socket on the motherboard.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How do we DISPOSE them?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Segrating the components:Separate and recycle plastic components if possible. Some recycling facilities accept certain types of plastics.</li>
                
                    <li>E-Waste Recycling Centers:

Look for electronic waste recycling centers or facilities in your area that accept CRT devices. These centers are equipped to handle the proper recycling and disposal of electronic components, including hazardous materials.</li>
               
                <li>Appliances should be recycled by facilities that safely remove hazardous components before shredding and recycling. Technicians can recover oil and other hazardous materials.</li>
                
                    <li>Recycle Through Manufacturers:

 Recycle metal components by taking them to a recycling facility.Glass can be recycled. Ensure it is separated and taken to a recycling facility.You may also need to remove your laptop’s battery to recycle that
separately. Flip your laptop over and remove it before sending it to a
recycler.</li>
            
                <li>Retailer Take-Back Programs:

Inquire with electronics retailers or manufacturers about take-back programs. Some companies have recycling initiatives in place, and they may provide options.Wipe your old laptop’s hard drive by manually deleting the files and, to
go a step further, using a shredding program to overwrite the files.</li>
                
                    <li>Do Not Dump:

Avoid dumping in regular trash bins or landfills. The hazardous materials in these devices can leach into the environment, posing risks to soil and water.</li>
